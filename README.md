# ProjetImageProcessing
Numpy ,Pillow , and Matplotlib for image processing

In this project we used those libraries to do some image processing as : 
-open image as numpy array
-manipulation of numpy array
-changing the scale 
-divide the image in three colors(RGB) 
-transform RGB image into grayScale image
-apply a glass filter
